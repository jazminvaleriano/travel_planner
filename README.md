# TripTrek

Welcome to the TripTrek project! This repository contains a prototype tool designed to simplify travel planning by generating itineraries, creating a budget and tracking expenses for your next adventure. 

## Features
* **Customizable Itineraries**: Users can specify their destination city, travel preferences and schedule. TripTrek Itinerary Generator will organize your activities efficiently, and estimate your trip costs, maximizing your time and enjoyment.
* **Budget Management**: You can use TripTrek to keep track of your trip expenses (such as accommodation costs, transportation, meals, and activities), and stay within budget. 
* **Data visualization and Trip Analysis**: Provide users with visualizations of their trip data, such as a timeline of planned activities or a breakdown of expenses by category. Allow users to analyze their travel patterns and budget usage to optimize future trips.  

_Features to be added only if time allows:_

* **Generate Daily Routes and Estimated Budget**: Say goodbye to the hassle of planning routes between attractions. Our tool automatically generates daily routes, based on distance starting from your initial location (such as your hotel), ensuring a smooth and enjoyable travel experience.
* **Retrieve Top-Rated Touristic Sites**: TripTrek will fetch the top-rated tourist attractions in your selected area, and prioritize them according to the duration of your trip. This ensures that your itinerary includes must-see landmarks and experiences.
